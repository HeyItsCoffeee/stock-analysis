# Refactoring with Excel

## Overview of Project
  Steve appreciates our effort and success in creating 
a button that he can use to analyze an entire dataset, but would now like 
to expand his research for his parents and analyze the entire stock market
over the past few years. The code we have created works well for a dozen stocks or so,
but, we'd like to avoid the possibilty of it taking a long time to execute
when he starts to analyze all stocks in the market from previous years.

What was our solution? It was to refactor the current code that we have. Refactoring code does
not change the functionality; it makes it more efficient. We're looking
to see if we can execute code with fewer steps, less memory, or just improving the logic
of the code. 

As you read further, you'll see how we were able to accomplish this for Steve.
